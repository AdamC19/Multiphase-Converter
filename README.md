# Multiphase Forward Converter
This repo contains the hardware source files for my digitally controlled multiphase isolated 1000W forward
converter. (firmware source code repo is
[here](https://github.com/AdamC19/Multiphase-Converter-FW).) This is a work in progress, first prototype is yet to
be built up!
