# Multiphase Forward Converter
This repo contains the hardware source files for my digitally controlled multiphase isolated 1000W forward
converter. (firmware source code repo is

## Update December 2020
First prototype has been built up, initial testing is promising! See more [here](http://acordingley.us/multiphase-converter/).
